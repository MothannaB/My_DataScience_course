troublshoot:
-track from begining and make sure you're getting the correct output after each step using print
-compare to a working version to spot the difference
-plant print stmts at begining of functions to see if that spot was reached
-divide big code into samll portions and invistigate them one at a time
-understand the components of the system and the flow of execution to isolate the braking point
-test functionality on a small data piece, once you confirm its woking, move to next
